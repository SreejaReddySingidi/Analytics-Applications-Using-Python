This project predicts loan approval based on factors like income, credit history, and education. Using a dataset, we handle missing values and outliers before applying K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification. Visualizations and statistical analysis reveal key trends and correlations. The model is trained and optimized to accurately forecast loan eligibility.
